Ingredients for Red Velvet Cake
Homemade cakes aren’t quit as simple as a cookie recipe, but this homemade cake doesn’t call for any specialty ingredients. you probably already have all of these in your cupboard right now!

All purpose flour: No need for cake flour here! Regular old all purpose flour will produce a tender and velvety crumb.
Cocoa powder: You’ll only need a little bit of cocoa powder to make that perfect hint of chocolate flavor.
Baking soda: Baking soda will work as the perfect leavener for this cake recipe! The buttermilk and vinegar give it a little extra oompf for the perfect rise.
Vegetable oil: We often like to bake our cakes with a combination of oil and butter, but when it comes to velvet cakes, oil will produce the silkiest texture!
Granulated sugar: Granulated sugar will sweeten your cake perfectly!
Eggs: Make sure your eggs are at room temperature to ensure they incorporate seamlessly into the batter! You’ll need 4 large eggs to create that perfect cakey, yet fudgy crumb.
Vanilla extract: Never skimp on vanilla extract. This is a chocolatey vanilla cake, after all so you’ll need a healthy dose of pure vanilla extract.
Vinegar: I know you don’t usually see this on your ingredient list for homemade cake, but the vinegar will give your cake a little extra tang for that perfect southern red velvet cake.
Buttermilk: If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can always make your own! Check out our homemade buttermilk recipe here!
Red food coloring: You can’t have red velvet cake without red food coloring! We used gel food coloring, but you can use whatever you have on hand and just adjust the quantities accordingly.
